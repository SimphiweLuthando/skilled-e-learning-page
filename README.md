## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

The landing page features an engaging and user-friendly design, with a clear and concise overview of the platform's offerings, benefits, and features. The design is fully responsive, ensuring that it looks great on all devices, and includes optimized code for fast loading times and a seamless user experience.

## Lessons Learned:

- Background images are a pain to work with
- Using the picture element instead helped big time in helping me make the hero section image responsive.
